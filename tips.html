              There are different types of diabetes, and no two people with
              diabetes are the same. So there isn’t a one-size-fits-all
              'diabetes diet' for everyone with diabetes. But we’ve come up with
              tips that you can use to help you make healthier food choices.
              <br />
              These healthy eating tips are general and can help you manage your

              Blood pressure (BP) is the force of blood against the walls of
              blood vessels, especially the large arteries. It is measured in
              millimeters of mercury (mmHg) above the atmospheric pressure145.
              It has two numbers: the systolic pressure (the maximum pressure
              when the heart beats) and the diastolic pressure (the minimum
              pressure when the heart rests). The ideal range for BP in adults
              is between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg45. High BP, or hypertension,
              is 140/90mmHg or higher and can cause serious health problems.

              Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused
              by a virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
              (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China,
              in December 2019. The disease quickly spread worldwide, resulting
              in the COVID-19 pandemic. The symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable
              but often include fever,cough, headache,fatigue, breathing
              difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. Symptoms may begin
              one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third
              of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms.Of
              those who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classified as
              patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild
              pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia,
              or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% develop
              critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan
              dysfunction).Older people are at a higher risk of developing
              severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of
              effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to
              organs has been observed.Multi-year studies are underway to
              further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.<br />

              Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder that affects
              the stomach and intestines, also called the gastrointestinal
              tract. Symptoms include cramping, abdominal pain, bloating, gas,
              and diarrhea or constipation, or both. IBS is a chronic condition
              that you'll need to manage long term. <br />
              <br />
              Only a small number of people with IBS have severe symptoms. Some
              people can control their symptoms by managing diet, lifestyle and
              stress. More-severe symptoms can be treated with medication and
              counseling.
              <br />
              <br />
              IBS doesn't cause changes in bowel tissue or increase your risk of
